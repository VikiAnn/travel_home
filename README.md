### The Pivot

This was a three week group project in which we took an existing project, an e-commerce site for a restaurant,
and pivoted it into a multi-tentant app for a different business concept.
Project expectations are located [here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/the_pivot.html).
